**Firstly, congrats.** You've made it! MDN gets a lot of extremly talented applicats, and we only accept the best—the truly passionate ones who we believe can add value to the team.

You might already have experience in **Deep Learning**, such as building neural networks, working with computer vision, or NLP. If so, check out this [section](hyperlink_somewhere).

If you're new to Deep Learning or have AI/ML experience but feel uncertain, don't worry. This training handbook and the AI team are here to help you go from zero to hero—building technical expertise, soft skills, and make it worthwhile at MDN.
   
### How AI in MDN Works
You choose a project to work on, usually released in **week 3**. It is a beginner project to help you get familar within a certain area in DL. You'll be assigned to a team with a project lead who is your first point of contact. They are there to guide and assist you. They should be knowledgeable enough / confident to support you.

### Developing Technical Expertise
One of the main reasons you have probably joined MDN is to upskill yourself with a motivated group of people.
Learning surface-level Deep Learning is pointless. Each section in DL—whether CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers—has unique theories, ideas, and syntax. While they share some concepts like backpropagation and activation functions, skimming the surface won't help you build projects effectively.

**Set your mentality.** Set a goal each semester. Don't just "exist". For example:
- "By the end of this semester, I want to be able to explain CNNs to someone in a really digestable way."
- "I want to learn and use the most popular frameworks : PyTorch and then certain models in HuggingFace and some Yolo Frameworks"


### Building Connections
MDN is full of ~~nerds~~ **really motivated people**. All the crypto/motivational/ money oriented online creators say : "Your network is your net worth,". Start getting to know others—your project managers (seriously, do this), your leads, me, and the people in the **Makerspace**. You never know who you'll meet.

I was inspired to leave my room. You might too.

Being present at the **Makerspace** shows commitment and makes people know you exist. 

Also please attend our key events:
- **O-week stalls** 
- **The Showcase** (our premier event)
- **The Outings**
- **The Industry Nights**

These events bring big names and open doors to unexpected opportunities. For example, attending an event led to a major milestone for MDN and career breaks for others—without any prior intention.

If you're considering becoming a **lead**, **assistant lead**, or joining **exclusive opportunities**, visibility matters. **No face, no case.** If noone knows you, that's not ideal.



### Setting Goals
This depends on your journey—what do you want to achieve by semester's end? Your project manager is suppoused to set concrete goals and deadlines. Reach out if they have not. Want to master a specific DL area? Take an up-to-date Udemy course. Try to complete keep it under 10 hours. 

Can MDN get funding for this? @Sponsorship team, let's talk.


### Summer Strategy
Summer is **4 months** long. Unfortunately, some of us won't have internships, so invest in yourself. So by the start of the year (when internship openings open up), you would have something new to show. By no means should you quit your partime job or should this affect your decision of doing a Summer unit. Do both. You can!

Yes, reward yourself—travel, relax—but when you're back, **set your monthly goal**. Working alone is hard, but remember, **you're part of MDN**. The Makerspace is active year-round.Make sure to drop by regularly.

Welcome aboard—let's make this semester count!

Psst... There’s more than one way to get involved with MDN! Want to hold a workshop or help clear student doubts? You can do that through our AI training program, where we upskill our members. Curious about how recruitment works (or want to flex a little power—my personal favorite)? Just reach out to the leads.


## Experienced members

Read articles and stay up to date. Challenge yourself and read papers,they make you more literate. Then propose projects.. . Not the simple beginner ones. Envision where this would take you or MDN or how it will possibly impress the people who come to the showcase. Take on the challenges of teahcing, editing and delivering a workshop. Update this handbook. It is outdated by the time it is published.  Find something interesting and bring it to MDN. This is key to how we stay afloat. The leads, when they brought you in do not expect you to be a beginner member. They probably thought this guy could possibly be the AI lead int the near future. Live up to it.
