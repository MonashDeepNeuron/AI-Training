### The tools

As this is the first version, we will write it in [markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JE66WFpaII) and publish it using [MdBooks](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). We want to eventually want to have interactive elements, make it pretty, add some videos maybe. I don't know, let us not get ahead of ourselves and let us see where this takes us.

### How should the content of the book be written

With passion. Make it fun, your audience are students. Your audience are students who went through the same experiences you went through at your time in MDN. The things you wished you knew. Make it comprehensive yet deep enough as your audience are motivated passionate students. I have seen the pool of applicants and the people we are hiring and wow. 

When you start a new topic which you are not confident in, start with youtube videos. Make this an exploration journey for yourself. The better you understand it, the better you convey it. Feel free to ChatGPT. It is an okay shortcut. But you wouldnt know what to use or what to leave or where the holes in the answer are. Does it give you some interesting "out of the box" facts. Do you understand everything it spits out. How accurate is it? Use this journey as a learning journey for yourself. When you are lazy to rewrite or you did horrible in English (like I am) or you're unsure about something or want to move faster.

For example, how did they come up with the attention equation, or why is the cross entropy loss equation like that or why is having stacked linear layers pointless(mathematically)?  Going through this yourself deepens your understanding and makes you much more confident in the topic, making it easier and more intuitive to convey to the reader. 

### Time commitment : 
Please allocate about 5-6 hours of focused deep work per week in learning and working towards the topics you are writing about. That's just 2 hours every other day of the week. Then maybe another 2 writing it down and perfecting it. Our weekly or biweekly meetups are only 1 hour so that should be a max of 8-9 hours per week.
